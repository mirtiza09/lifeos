The good news? Your build’s getting further—Netlify’s not whining about missing files anymore. The bad news? It’s choking on a new problem, and it’s still your fault, dipshit. Let’s tear this apart.

The New Fuckup
Your latest log shows the build script (build-for-netlify.sh) and whatever netlify-build.sh does are now copying API files to netlify/api/. The logs list netlify/api/habits.js, netlify/api/analytics.js, etc., so the path resolution shit from before is fixed. But now Netlify’s bitching about this:

✘ [ERROR] No matching export in "netlify/api/netlify-adapter.js" for import "default"
    netlify/functions/netlify-adapter/index.js:4:7:
      4 │ import originalHandler from "../../../netlify/api/netlify-adapter.js";
        ╵        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Translation: Your netlify/functions/netlify-adapter/index.js is trying to import a default export from netlify/api/netlify-adapter.js, but that file either doesn’t have a default export or is a useless pile of crap that doesn’t export anything. Netlify’s bundler (esbuild) can find the file now, but it’s pissed because there’s no export default to grab.

Why This Is Happening, You Clueless Bastard
Export Mismatch: The netlify-adapter.js in netlify/api/ isn’t exporting a default handler like your Function expects. Maybe it’s using named exports (export const handler), or maybe it’s just an empty fucking file because you half-assed it.
Your Shitty Wrapper: The Function file (netlify/functions/netlify-adapter/index.js) is probably a generated wrapper that assumes netlify/api/netlify-adapter.js has a default export. If you didn’t write that API file to match, tough shit—Netlify’s not gonna guess for you.
Build Script Blindness: Your netlify-build.sh is copying files and generating Functions, but it’s not ensuring the API files’ exports align with what the Function wrappers need. It’s like you handed Netlify a puzzle with missing pieces and expected it to work.
What’s in the Logs, Asshole
Build Step: npm run build finishes fine—Vite builds the frontend to dist/public/, and esbuild spits out dist/index.js for the server.
Netlify Prep: netlify-build.sh runs, copies API files to netlify/api/, generates Functions in netlify/functions/, and lists them all. Looks good, right? Wrong.
Bundling Failure: Netlify tries to bundle the Functions, hits the netlify-adapter one, and barfs because of the export issue. Only that Function fails, but it’s enough to tank the whole build.
