Invoke functions while running Netlify Dev
Use netlify dev to start a local development environment and Netlify Dev will run the functions as they would run in the Netlify production environment.

To get started, configure the functions directory in your netlify.toml and then run netlify dev.

The functions will be accessible at http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/function-name in the browser. Accessing the function through the browser simulates a GET request but you can also use netlify functions:invoke to test other requests. For example, the CLI also models POST requests.

You can use netlify functions: list to get a list of all detected functions.

If you run functions in your local environment with Netlify Dev, you can then test sending payloads of data or authentication payloads:

netlify functions:invoke # we will prompt you at each step
netlify functions:invoke myfunction # invoke a specific function
netlify functions:invoke --name myfunction # invoke a specific function

# sending payloads
netlify functions:invoke myfunction --payload '{"count": 1}'
netlify functions:invoke myfunction --querystring "count=1"
netlify functions:invoke myfunction --payload "./pathTo.json"

There are special cases for event-triggered functions that will also provide mock data for testing. This makes it possible to manually test event-triggered functions locally and improves the development experience.

#Serve functions with a standalone server locally
While Netlify Dev will simulate the Netlify production environment, it can be useful to simulate Netlify Functions in a standalone server instead. If you serve functions with a standalone server, you can debug functions without the overhead of starting a framework server.

To start a functions server locally, run netlify functions:serve. Your function will be available at http://localhost:9999/.netlify/functions/<function-name>

If you configure a functions directory, the server will serve functions from that directory. If not, the server will serve functions from netlify/functions. The default port for the functions server is 9999.

To override these settings, use the --functions and --port flags:

netlify functions:serve --functions <path-to-dir> --port <port>

You can also configure the settings in a netlify.toml, under the dev block:

[dev]
  functions = "netlify-functions"
  functionsPort = 7000

#Debug functions locally
Netlify CLI uses Lambda-local to simulate serverless functions. Since the CLI invokes functions in the same process as the functions server, you can debug functions by inspecting the functions server process.

To debug, set the --inspect Node.js option when starting the functions server:

On Windows, run cmd /V /C "set NODE_OPTIONS=--inspect && netlify functions:serve"
On Mac/Linux, run NODE_OPTIONS=--inspect netlify functions:serve
Then, attach any Node.js debugger to the CLI process to debug your functions. To learn how to debug with Visual Studio Code while running the Netlify CLI, review Debug with VS Code.
