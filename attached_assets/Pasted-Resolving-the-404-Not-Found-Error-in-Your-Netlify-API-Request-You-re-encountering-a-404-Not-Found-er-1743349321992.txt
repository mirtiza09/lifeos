Resolving the 404 Not Found Error in Your Netlify API Request
You're encountering a 404 Not Found error when making an API request in your Netlify-deployed application, built with React, Vite, and Netlify Functions. Instead of receiving the expected JSON response, you're getting an HTML "Page not found" page. This issue arises from a failed fetch request, likely tied to a mutation operation (e.g., creating or updating data), as indicated by the stack trace referencing mutationFn. Let’s break this down and resolve it step-by-step.

Understanding the Problem
A 404 error means the requested endpoint doesn’t exist or isn’t correctly configured. In your case:

The frontend is making an API call, expecting JSON data.
The response is Netlify’s default 404 HTML page, suggesting the server couldn’t find the requested resource.
The app uses Netlify Functions, typically accessed via /.netlify/functions/, and possibly a custom /api/* path rewritten by a netlify.toml redirect or an adapter like netlify-adapter.js.
The stack trace shows the error originates from a file like index-Dno35ddT.js, likely your bundled frontend code, and involves a mutation function (e.g., from React Query or SWR). This suggests the issue lies either in how the frontend constructs the request URL or how the backend function is deployed.

Step-by-Step Debugging and Solution
1. Identify the Requested URL
The exact URL causing the 404 isn’t specified in the error message, so we need to pinpoint it.

Action: Open your browser’s developer tools (F12 or right-click > Inspect) and go to the Network tab.
Trigger the action that causes the error (e.g., submitting a form to create a task).
Look for a failed request (status code 404). Note the full URL, e.g., https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/tasks or https://your-site.netlify.app/api/tasks.
2. Check URL Rewriting
Your app likely uses a fetch adapter (netlify-adapter.js) to rewrite /api/* requests to /.netlify/functions/*. Misconstructed URLs are a common culprit.

Verify the Adapter: Ensure your adapter looks something like this:
javascript

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
const originalFetch = window.fetch;
window.fetch = function(url, options) {
  console.log('Original fetch URL:', url);
  let newUrl = url;
  if (typeof url === 'string' && url.startsWith('/api')) {
    newUrl = url.replace(/^\/api/, '/.netlify/functions');
    console.log(`Rewriting API request: ${url} → ${newUrl}`);
  }
  return originalFetch.call(this, newUrl, options);
};
Test It: Reload the page, trigger the error, and check the browser console for logs like:
Original fetch URL: /api/tasks
Rewriting API request: /api/tasks → /.netlify/functions/tasks
Common Issue: If you see Original fetch URL: /api/api/tasks rewriting to /.netlify/functions/api/tasks, the frontend is adding an extra /api prefix.
Fix: In your frontend code (e.g., client/src/api/ or where mutations are defined), ensure the URL is constructed correctly:
javascript

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
// Incorrect
fetch('/api' + '/api/tasks', { method: 'POST', ... });

// Correct
fetch('/api/tasks', { method: 'POST', ... });
Check for base URL concatenation errors, especially if using an API client or environment variables.
3. Verify Netlify Function Deployment
Assuming the rewritten URL is /.netlify/functions/tasks, confirm the function exists.

Check the Dashboard:
Log in to Netlify, go to your site, and navigate to the Functions tab.
Look for a function named tasks. It should appear as tasks if your file is netlify/functions/tasks/index.js.
Test Directly:
Visit https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/tasks in a browser or use Postman.
If it returns JSON or a function response, the function is deployed correctly.
If it returns a 404, the function isn’t deployed or is misnamed.
Function Code: Ensure the function exports a handler:
javascript

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
// CommonJS (if using Node.js default)
exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Hello from tasks!' }),
  };
};

// ESM (if using --format=esm)
export const handler = async (event, context) => {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Hello from tasks!' }),
  };
};
A missing or incorrectly named handler export could cause issues, though this typically results in a deployment error, not a 404.
4. Validate netlify.toml Redirects
If your app uses custom API paths (e.g., /api/tasks), check your netlify.toml:

toml

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true
This redirects /api/tasks to /.netlify/functions/tasks.
Ensure the :splat matches your function name (e.g., tasks).
5. Redeploy and Test
Make Changes: Fix any URL construction errors in the frontend or function naming issues.
Redeploy: Push your changes to GitHub (or your repo) to trigger a new Netlify build.
Test Again: Trigger the action and monitor the Network tab and console logs.
Likely Scenarios and Fixes
Scenario 1: Double /api Prefix
Cause: Frontend code constructs /api/api/tasks, rewritten to /.netlify/functions/api/tasks, which doesn’t exist.
Fix: Correct the fetch call to /api/tasks.
Scenario 2: Function Not Deployed
Cause: The tasks function isn’t in netlify/functions/ or failed to deploy.
Fix: Verify the file exists and redeploy.
Scenario 3: Mismatched Function Name
Cause: Requesting /.netlify/functions/tasks but the function is named differently (e.g., task).
Fix: Align the request URL with the deployed function name.
Final Verification
After fixes, a successful request to /.netlify/functions/tasks should return JSON, not HTML.
If logs show no requests hitting the function (check Netlify’s Functions logs), the URL is still incorrect.
If the issue persists, share the exact URL from the Network tab or console logs for further assistance. This process should resolve your 404 error and get your API working as expected!
