# Progressive Web App (PWA) Implementation

This document describes how the Life OS application has been converted into a Progressive Web App (PWA).

## What is a PWA?

A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies. It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser, including both desktop and mobile devices.

## Benefits of PWA

- **Installable**: Users can add the app to their home screen
- **Offline Support**: Works when the network connection is poor or unavailable
- **App-like Experience**: Provides a full-screen experience similar to native apps
- **Automatic Updates**: Always serves the latest version

## Implementation Details

### 1. Manifest File

The `manifest.json` file in the `client/public` directory provides metadata about the application:

```json
{
  "name": "Life OS",
  "short_name": "Life OS",
  "description": "A personal productivity and habit tracking dashboard",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#000000",
  "icons": [...]
}
```

### 2. Service Worker

The service worker (`service-worker.js`) enables offline functionality by caching assets:

- It caches the application shell during installation
- It intercepts network requests and serves cached content when offline
- It updates the cache when new versions are deployed

### 3. Icons

Icons for the PWA were created based on the triangle logo from the application header:
- 192x192 icon for standard usage
- 512x512 icon for high-resolution displays

### 4. HTML Modifications

The `index.html` file was updated to include necessary PWA meta tags:

```html
<meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" />
<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json" />
<link rel="icon" href="/icons/icon-192x192.svg" />
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/icons/icon-192x192.svg" />
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />
```

### 5. Service Worker Registration

The service worker is registered in the main application code:

```typescript
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js')
      .then(registration => {
        console.log('Service Worker registered with scope:', registration.scope);
      });
  });
}
```

### 6. Docker Integration

The Dockerfile has been updated to include PWA assets in the final build:

```dockerfile
# Copy PWA assets
COPY --from=builder /app/client/public/manifest.json ./dist/manifest.json
COPY --from=builder /app/client/public/service-worker.js ./dist/service-worker.js
COPY --from=builder /app/client/public/icons ./dist/icons
```

## Testing PWA Functionality

To verify the PWA functionality:

1. Open the application in Chrome or another modern browser
2. Open the browser's developer tools
3. Navigate to the "Application" tab
4. Look for the "Manifest" and "Service Workers" sections to confirm they're active
5. Look for the install prompt in the browser's address bar or menu

## Installation Instructions for Users

Users can install the Life OS PWA on their devices by:

1. Visiting the application in a supported browser
2. Clicking the "Add to Home Screen" or "Install" option that appears
   - In Chrome, this appears as a small "+" icon in the address bar
   - In Safari on iOS, it's the "Share" button followed by "Add to Home Screen"
3. Following the on-screen instructions to complete the installation

Once installed, the application will appear on the user's home screen or app launcher and can be launched like any other application.
